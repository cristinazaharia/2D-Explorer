# 2D-Explorer

  Then the user can play the game. A player comes in action and it needs to be piloted. In order to make this possible, the user needs to use the left, right arrows to move and the up arrow to jump. The player's purpose is collecting coins. In the left up corner a score is being counted: initially it is set to 0 and each time the player collects a coin, the score is being increased by 1.

  There are also obstacles in player's way: a evil turtle tries to stop the player from achieving its goal and a tunnel without way of escaping tries to lure the player in.
